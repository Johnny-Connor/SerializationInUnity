# About it
"Serializing (Saving) and Deserializing (Loading) is performant, secure, and an industry standard."

_- Jonathan Weinberger, from GameDevHQ._

 In this project, I will watch GameDevHQ's tutorial video (https://youtu.be/GoHYSOFiZHc) to learn how to create, save and load serialized data. The code will have many explanatory comments to facilitate its comprehension in case I forget something about it.
 
If you have any interest in learning about this topic or just want a written summary of GameDevHQ's video, feel free to take a look at my notes!

# Roadmap
- [x] Create a scene that randomizes player data.
- [x] Make the serialization save/load work for both common and unity exclusive data types.
- [ ] Optimize the serialization process to match the industry standards (Timestamp: 23:16).
- [ ] Explain the crucial parts of the code through comments.
